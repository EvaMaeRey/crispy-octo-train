Welcome to ggplot2 extenders/ggplot2 extension club. This forum exists to facilitate conversations about experiences with extension. We like to talk about motivations, challenges, equivocations â€” in general, extension journeys!

Our main activities are [meetings](./meetings.html) and [discussions](./discussion.html).

Interested in joining us? Please leave your contact info [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3M1KwUPrmTfEGuuQp0fZ0J7dZkk_82gb310JCvdouMTa_7Q/viewform) and let us know a little about your interest in ggplot2 extension so we can be in touch!

Note that the extension ecosystem is extensive and other initiatives exist to support extenders, check out some [other resources](./additional-resources.html).
